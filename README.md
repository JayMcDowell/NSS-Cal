Cal for NSS Part II
1  I want to be able to accept 2 arguments and use those to build a "month_header" consisting of the month and year that is centered.  I have worked through this section and have gotten a lot more confident in my programming.
2  I am working on the situation where the user enters the month name instead of a number.  I've figured out in Cal that if you put the first 3 letters of a month it works.  For example, Sep 1954 returns the month, where Se 1954 doesn't.  Also, if you use at least the first 3 letters, it works... SepJay 1954 works as well as SepCanada 1954 to return September 1954.
3  The "day_header" will be a consistent line that consists of each day "Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa".
4  Using Zellars Congruence, we will establish what day of the week the first day lands on.
5  We must find out how many weeks are in any given month.  This will allow us to print out every day.
6  Cal responds with a 12 month answer if only the year is entered.  This will need to be integrated.
7  I'm really liking this TDD stuff.  It's a bit of a learning curve to not just jump in and start biting off big chunks at first.  Thanks for helping us get this stuff going!
